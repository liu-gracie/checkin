    <p class="text">
      Welcome to checkinwithmbc.com :) glad you’re here. You might notice that we ask you a different question everyday, collect your response, and allow you to share it if you want or self reflect if you would prefer instead. While this is a fun activity that anyone and everyone can participate in, the practice of logging your emotions and observing this data correlates directly to a therapy practice known as measurement based care.

    <h2 class="subtitle">what is measurement based care (mbc)?</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Measurement Based Care is a way therapists use data to help you feel better, faster. Before or during therapy, you fill out short check-ins. Your answers turn into real-time insights. Your therapist sees patterns. What’s working. What’s not. And adjusts your care accordingly. Measurement Based Care is personalized therapy with proven results. Real care starts when you check in.
