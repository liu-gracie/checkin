  <h2 class="subtitle">why check in here every day?</h2>
  <p class="text">
    Welcome to <strong>checkinwithmbc.com</strong> :) Each day on this site, you'll see that we have a new question for you. You can answer it, then share it or keep it to yourself and view past responses. It’s a simple daily habit, but behind the scenes, this kind of check-in ties into a powerful therapy approach called Measurement-Based Care. 
  </p>

  <h2 class="subtitle">what’s Measurement-Based Care (MBC)?</h2>
  <p class="text">
    MBC is a way therapists use your own data to help you feel better, faster. You do quick check-ins before or during therapy, and your answers turn into real-time insights. Your therapist can spot patterns—what’s helping, what’s not—and tweak your care to match. Think of it as smart, personalized therapy that actually responds to you. It all starts when you check in.

  <h2 class="subtitle">what can I do to feel better?</h2>
  <p class="text">
    Answering our daily questions is a great start, but a licensed therapist or doctor is your best partner in this journey. If you're working with one, talk to them about using MBC and connect your account to your patient portal. We’ll send gentle nudges to help you stay on track and make filling out your MBC forms super easy!
